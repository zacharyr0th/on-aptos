Indexer API Table Reference
Indexer API Reference
The Indexer API allows you to access rich data about tokens, fungible assets, and accounts on-chain using GraphQL queries. You can access it here.

For common queries, check out the sidebar for examples to work from. When building your own, this reference guide should help you determine which tables are most relevant, and how to format your queries.

Before relying on a table for production services, check the bottom of this page to see if that table is deprecated. If so, use the note section for guidance on what to do to migrate to a non-deprecated table.

If you are looking up a table with the _by_pk suffix, search for the table name without that suffix. _by_pk tables are automatically generated for convenience to allow querying by primary key.


Indexer Table Reference
Remember to use Ctrl + F to find the table you are interested in! When in doubt, you may also want to query the Hasura tables linked in the Indexer API Access page to see examples of the data inside.

Filtering (with where clauses)
To ensure your queries filter data efficiently, check out the available indexes for each table. Some indexes are composite B-tree indexes, meaning they consist of multiple columns. B-tree indexes are ordered and perform optimally when queries utilize a left-most prefix of the indexed columns.
