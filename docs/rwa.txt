Common Measures
Measures are quantitative properties about an entity that are most commonly retrieved on a current or historical time series basis. The following table displays all measures in our data model.

Not all measures apply to all assets. We document this in the “Availability” column:

“All tokens” refers to tokenized assets which conform to a common token standard. Examples of these standards include ERC-{20, 721, 1155}, NEP-141, SPL, TRC-20, and others. Exceptions to this are for tokens on Sui, Noble, and Stellar.
